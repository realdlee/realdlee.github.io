I attended the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in May 2015, and it was a blast.  Since it was my first time, I had questions through the process and had difficulty finding the answers.  Here, I’ll share some info and tips on how you can attend and make the most of the event.

# What is it?
Every spring, investors from around the world flock to Omaha, Nebraska to learn from the "Oracle of Omaha" Warren Buffett. It’s the Woodstock of annual meetings and is a 3-day celebration of all things Berkshire Hathaway. In 2015, a record 44,000 people attended the 50th anniversary shareholder meeting. If you’re not familiar with Berkshire Hathaway, then brush up by reading [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway "Wikipedia") or [that](http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/04/investing/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-shareholder-meeting-recap/ "Recap of 2015 Meeting").

#Meeting Credentials
To attend the meeting and shareholder weekend activities, you only need to have a meeting credential.  The easiest way to get a credential is by being a Berkshire shareholder (class A or class B shares) which allows you to request up to 4 credentials per shareholder. So it only takes a single class B share to get you in the door for the weekend.

If you’re not currently a shareholder, then it’s important to know that you must be a shareholder at least 60 days before the meeting (the "record date").  Since the meeting typically occurs on the last weekend of April or first weekend of May, you should own the stock by roughly the last week of February or first week of March.  To play it safe, allot sufficient time so that the settlement date, not just purchase date, meets the cutoff.  Note the [2016 Annual Meeting](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sharehold.html) will be on April 30, 2016.

Technically, you can attend without being a shareholder by buying a credential off eBay for relatively cheap (~$20 a piece). But if you’re thinking of making the trip to Omaha, then there’s a strong chance that you’re an investor and Buffett fan, so you may as well be a bona-fide Berkshire shareholder.

All shareholders by the record date will receive the annual report in mid-March which includes a postcard that you must submit to request credentials.  Don’t worry if you receive your brokerage statements and shareholder materials electronically.  If you do, you can just print the form and mail it in.  Berkshire starts sending out the credentials around the first week of April, so keep an eye for them around that time.

#Flights
You have 2 main options for where to fly into. Eppley Field airport is the closest and is located in Omaha.  The second option is Kansas City International Airport (169 miles away). Flights to/from Omaha were expensive and inconvenient (layovers, bad times) for me, so I flew through Kansas City. Kansas City has a good-sized airport, more flights, cheaper fares, and some interesting attractions. Bear in mind that it’s about a 2.5 hour drive each way, but if you enjoy driving and have the time, then I recommend it.

There are a few other airports to choose from in Des Moines, Iowa (135 miles) and Sioux City, Iowa (90 miles), but both are small.

#Hotels
The Berkshire Hathaway meeting is one of the biggest events in Omaha and accommodations are tough to come by. The majority of events take place at CenturyLink Center--a large convention center and area in downtown--so staying in downtown is ideal.  Downtown hotels sell out early, but if you plan in advance, then the Hilton directly next to CenturyLink is as close as you can get.

Outside of downtown, there are pockets of hotels in areas across Omaha like Midtown, Bellevue, etc.  One of the best options is surprisingly in Council Bluffs, Iowa.  Although located in an entirely different state, Council Bluffs is only about 10 minutes from CenturyLink.  One week before the meeting, I saw rooms at the Marriott Fairfield for the reasonable rate of $220.

Another option is to stay in Lincoln, Nebraska (54 miles away).  It’s a hike, but it’s far enough away from Omaha that the hotels don’t jack up the rates and the Marriott Courtyard will even accept reward points for your stay, which isn’t the case for closer hotels.

In the lead-up to the 2015 meeting, Buffett recommended Airbnb for accommodations during the meeting.  Unfortunately, I found the offerings to be limited in 2015.  I’m a big fan of Airbnb, so I’m optimistic that Airbnb will be a better resource in the future.

#Getting Around
You may be wondering if you need a rental car for the weekend. If you’re just staying for the Saturday meeting and you’re staying in downtown, then you can easily get by without one.  Otherwise, having a car is really nice to have.  The Berkshire meeting has several events that aren’t at CenturyLink.  For the most part, they offer shuttle buses, but having a car will give you a lot more flexibility and save you from waiting in shuttle lines. Having a car will also make it easier for you to take in some of the sights (like the famous Omaha zoo) and get away from the crowds in downtown.

Stay tuned for Part 2 where I'll talk about what the actual shareholder weekend is like.
