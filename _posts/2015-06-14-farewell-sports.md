At 1am, after I had read all the recaps and rewatched the highlights from a surprisingly anticlimactic game 4 of the NBA Finals, I decided to cut sports out of my life. I don't mean the playing of sports, just the consumption of sports as a fan.

How much time do I spend exactly? First off, I support a lot of teams: the SF Giants, the Warriors, the 49ers, the Cowboys, the Mavericks, Texas football, Duke football, and my favorite sports team of them all, Duke basketball.  Along with my teams, I naturally follow all the respective leagues. I also keep current on the Champions League, our national men’s and women’s soccer team, major tennis tournaments, horse races, golf majors, World Cup qualifiers, the occasional rugby game, and just about anything that ESPN will report on.

To free myself, I’m cutting out *all* sports content from my life, which specifically means I won't be:

- watching games
- watching Sportscenter
- watching Youtube sports videos
- reading ESPN.com or any sports websites
- following any sports-related accounts on Twitter

Wish me luck. I'll try this for 3 months to start. I hope to be a more focused and present person. I'll begin once the NBA Finals conclude. Go Warriors!
