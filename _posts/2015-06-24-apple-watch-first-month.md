I’m a watch wearer. I’ve always been one since I was a little kid. But for the past few years, I stopped wearing one and started using my phone to tell time. But when Apple announced their watch in the fall, I was immediately interested. I’ve now had the watch for about a month and I’m happy with it even though it has clear flaws.

#What I like...

*It’s beautiful.*  I’ve played around with other smartwatches, and they all felt a little cheap. But Apple watch has some heft to it and feels like a well-designed and constructed watch. Don’t confuse this with high fashion, but Apple has brought fresh perspective to the watchmaking industry. For example, their sports watch bands are a nice improvement over the standard design. The end of the sports band comfortably tucks under the band, so that it is out of the way.  Every other leather or sports band I’ve seen has the end of the band secured through a loop. This works ok, but the end of the band pokes out and sometimes the loop breaks. Their sports link bracelet also improves over the norm. Other link bands require a visit to the watch store or patience and a special tool. Apple made it easy and removing a link can be done with no tools and in a fraction of the time.

*Battery life is solid.* I haven’t come close to running out of battery or even using the power reserve. On average, I have over 50% battery life at the end of the day, which is much better than Apple’s 18 hour battery life estimate.

*Fitness tracking.* I’m a runner and I’ve used a Garmin Forerunner 310xt triathlon watch and apps like Runkeeper on my phone. The problem is that I don’t like running with my phone and the Garmin was buggy and slow to load. Apple watch meets my needs for a running watch since I can track my runs and listen to music without a phone. Apple watch doesn’t have GPS, but I don’t mind not having geolocation data for my runs.

# What I don’t like...

*Apps aren’t there yet.* I haven’t found an app that has wowed me. Worse, apps can be slow and they feel really slow. Apple’s stocks and maps apps are two prime offenders. You see the spinner of death at every touch.

*Wearing a watch and not knowing the time.* To conserve battery life, Apple watch sleeps for most of the day and the screen appears blank. When you raise your wrist to look at the watch, the screen turns on. This works well 95% of the time, but requires a slightly exaggerated wrist turn. It’s the 5% of times where the display doesn’t turn on that bug me. There’s also a slight but perceptible lag while you wait for the screen to turn on. Apple will hopefully let users select a wrist detection sensitivity setting since I’d gladly exchange some battery life for the Apple watch to tell the time as reliably as a traditional watch.

*Battery life is too short.* Don’t get me wrong, battery life is better than expected, but I still am obligated to charge it daily. Getting it to run for 7 days on a single charge would be ideal. Even basic tracking devices like a Fitbit Flex only get 5 days, so we may be waiting a while for this one.

All in all, I’m pleased with the watch and don’t want to give it up. Perhaps of all of Apple watch’s features, I’m most excited about *its future*. It’s getting better and better very quickly. At this month’s Apple’s developer conference, they announced many new developments: some minor---like new watch faces and an alarm clock mode---and some major---like running native apps right on the phone which will lead to zippier apps. Apple’s putting tons of resources into this and we’re only at the beginning.
