Last night was the first class meeting for the [CodePath Android Mobile Bootcamp](https://codepath.com/). We spent the first 15 minutes introducing ourselves. The class has 30 in-person students, 30 remote students, and 40 observers. The 30 students hail from companies of all types and sizes: 5 from Uber, big companies like Cisco and LinkedIn, some from bootstrapped startups, and everything in between. The 30 in-person students were selected from 1,000 applicants. Overall, a very impressive group.

The lead instructor is Nathan, one of the co-founders of CodePath. He talked about the mission of CodePath and why Android development is so critical (globally over 80% of smartphones are Android and smartphone penetration is growing like crazy with no end in sight). One of the most impressive things is that CodePath has never taken money from an individual student. They make all their revenue from companies who pay CodePath to train their engineers. Thanks [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/codepath-partnership/)!

Next, Nathan spoke about the project-focused nature of the course. We only have 4 hours of class time a week, but we have a major project due every Sunday at 10pm. Each project has several required specs and many other recommended ones. He used the phrase “choose-your-own adventure” which drove home the point that this is *our* experience and can be as rich and educational as we can dream it. He showcased some of the top todo app’s from our cohort's applications. As part of the application process, we each created a todo app with basic features like adding, deleting, editing todo’s ([here’s mine](https://github.com/realdlee/todo_app)). The top examples all had clean, attractive designs. One of the more unique apps associated each todo with a location and with geofencing, alerted the user when they were near a todo location.

For the second half of the evening, we broke up into 6 groups and dissected two of our favorite mobile apps. My group choose Venmo and Google Play Store. We discussed the apps' screen archetypes, data models, and unique features and user experiences.

I’m excited about my Android adventure. It’s a privilege to be in this talented group.  I’ll try to share my thoughts every week.
