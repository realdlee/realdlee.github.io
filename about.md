My name is David Lee.  I'm a lawyer-turned software engineer living in San Francisco.  I'm currently Director of Product Engineering at [BuildZoom](http://www.buildzoom), where we connect homeowners with the best contractors and remodelers in their city.

I enjoy building things, [reading](/books), travel, and running.

This blog is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the [mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator)  theme.
